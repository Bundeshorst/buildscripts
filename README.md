# buildscripts for homeean

[**homeean**](https://himpler.com/homeean) is a web based buildtool, which generates an individual buildscript (Bash-Script) for user selected Smart Home Tools to be installed on a Raspberry Pi running on Raspbian. 

These tools are mainly provided for the use with the Smart Home Gateway [**homee**](https://hom.ee) in order to extend its functionality and provide interfaces to other tools & standards. 

Target group for homeean are users with limited knowledge of Linux system administration.

The name "homeean" has been chosen as a tribute to [**Debian**](https://www.debian.org) (forefather of [**Raspbian**](https://www.raspian.org)) and homee.

homeean is intentionally always written in lower case (as is homee), even at the beginning of a sentence ;-)
